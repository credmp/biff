# Biff

A Clojure web framework for solo developers. See [biffweb.com](https://biffweb.com).

## Contributing

Documentation source is located at [github.com/jacobobryant/biffweb.com](https://github.com/jacobobryant/biffweb.com),
under `content/docs`. Feel free to submit corrections.

Also check out the [content library](https://biffweb.com/docs/library/). If you write an experience report, how-to guide (could be as simple
as pasting some code into a gist) or other Biff-related blog post, I'll add it there.

PRs for the code are also welcome. To hack on Biff, either run `bb dev` or `cd starter; clj -M:dev dev`. (The starter
project's deps.edn declares a local dependency on the Biff library code.)

Finally, check out [the roadmap](https://github.com/users/jacobobryant/projects/2). These are the main tasks I'm planning to work on myself, and many of them are
exploratory. If any of them look interesting to you, I'd be happy to chat more.

## Sponsors
